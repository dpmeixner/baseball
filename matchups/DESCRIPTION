Description: This package compares models that are used to predict the outcome 
  of an event in baseball. Specifically, it examines the strikeout probability 
  between batters and pitchers, but could be easily extended to other events 
  (team win probabilities, home run probabilities, etc.) It currently examines 
  the log5 model developed by Bill James, and compares that with a logistic 
  regression model. Again, other models could be easily added that take on the 
  form E = c0*X + c1*Y + c2*Z, where E is the predicted probability of that 
  outcome given inputs from factors X and Y and Z is the population average.
